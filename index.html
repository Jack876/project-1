    <hr/>
    <ul style="font-family:verdana">
      <li>Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. </li><br/>
      <li>Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics.</li><br/>
      <li>In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office.</li><br/>
      <li> In 1905 he obtained his doctor's degree.</li><br/>
      <li>During his stay at the Patent Office, and in his spare time, he produced much of his remarkable work and in 1908 he was appointed Privatdozent in Berne.</li><br/>
      <li> In 1909 he became Professor Extraordinary at Zurich, in 1911 Professor of Theoretical Physics at Prague, returning to Zurich in the following year to fill a similar post.</li><br/>
      <li>In 1914 he was appointed Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor in the University of Berlin. </li> <br/>    
     <li>In 1914 he was appointed Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor in the University of Berlin. </li><br/>

      <li>He became a German citizen in 1914 and remained in Berlin until 1933 when he renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton*. </li><br/>
      <li> He became a United States citizen in 1940 and retired from his post in 1945. </li><br/>
      <li> Einstein's researches are, of course, well chronicled and his more important works include Special Theory of Relativity (1905), Relativity (English translations, 1920 and 1950), General Theory of Relativity (1916), Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement (1926), and The Evolution of Physics (1938). Among his non-scientific works, About Zionism (1930), Why War? (1933), My Philosophy (1934), and Out of My Later Years (1950) are perhaps the most important. </li><br/>
      <li>  He married Mileva Maric in 1903 and they had a daughter and two sons; their marriage was dissolved in 1919 and in the same year he married his cousin, Elsa Löwenthal, who died in 1936. He died on April 18, 1955 at Princeton, New Jersey. </li>
